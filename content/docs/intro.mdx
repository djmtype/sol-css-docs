SOL is a drop-in, classless styles utility for native HTML elements. 

On some elementary level, SOL can be customized since it's built upon CSS custom properties.

## Why SOL?

Honestly, I can't think of a good reason *for* or *against*. There might be better suited classless libraries out in the wild like [picoCSS](https://picocss.com), [WaterCSS](https://watercss.kognise.dev/), and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/). SOL is yet another option. Its footprint isn't the smallest, nor the most complete. But, if you want to try something new, then this one's for you! 

## Usage

Choose one of the following options.

### Install from a CDN 

Add to your `<head>` 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/djmtype/build/sol.css">
```

### Install from NPM

```bash
npm i sol-css
```
Then, import `sol-css/sol.css` into your project.


### Install Manually

Download [SOL-CSS](https://github.com/djmtype/sol-css).  
Place `sol-css.css` within your styles directory.  
Add a `<link>` within your `<head>`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/sol.css">
```
