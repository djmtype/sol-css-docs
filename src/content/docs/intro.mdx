SOL is a drop-in, classless styles utility for native HTML elements. 

On some elementary level, SOL can be customized since it's built upon CSS custom properties.

## Why SOL?

Honestly, I can't think of a good reason *for* or *against*. There might be better suited classless libraries out in the wild like [picoCSS](https://picocss.com), [WaterCSS](https://watercss.kognise.dev/), and [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/). SOL is yet another option. Its footprint isn't the smallest, nor the most complete. But, if you want to try something new, then this one's for you! 

## Overview

SOL comes in 3 flavors. Choose your own adventure.

### Reset
A compilation of primitive styles from other resets like Andy Bell and Open Props. All rules are defined within `:where()` for easy overrides.  

### Core
Builds upon the reset, plus includes a theme layer for colors, typography, spacing, and light/dark schemes all defined by custom properties. 

### Complete
Includes the core foundation plus styles for most browser-shipped HTML elements like forms, dialog, details/summary, progress, and table.

## Installation

The installation and usage instructions apply to the **Complete** package, but the same rules can be applied for adding the **Reset** or **Core** instead. 

Choose 1 of the 3 options below.

### Reference from a CDN 

Add the following syntax to your document's `<head>` 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/djmtype/sol-css@refs/heads/main/build/minified/sol.css">
```

### Install Manually

1. Download [SOL CSS](https://github.com/djmtype/sol-css/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).  
2. Open up the `build` or `build/minified` directory.  
3. Place `sol.css` within your `styles` directory.  
4. Add a `<link>` within your `<head>`.

```html
<!-- Example -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/sol.css">
```

### Install the Package

During the alpha stage, SOL is currently unavailable on *npmjs.com*.  
Install directly from Github using NPM or other package manager.

```zsh
npm install github:djmtype/sol-css#main
```
#### Use with LightningCSS or PostCSS[^1]

[^1]: PostCSS requires a few additional plugins: [`postcss-import`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-import), [`postcss-input-range`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-input-range), [`postcss-preset-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-preset-env).

```css
@import "sol-css/sol.css";
/* OR */
/* @import "node_modules/sol-css/sol.css" */
```

#### Use without a Process

```css
@import "sol-css/build/sol.css";
