When it comes to CSS custom properites, SOL declares some sensible semantic names for design consistency. Think of them as aliases. (Whether this is helpful or not is yet to be determined.) 

They attempt to address the following:  

- Equal heights among input fields and buttons.
- Reduce the recall on spacing sizes. 
- Alleviate color contrast concerns pertaining to <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> standards. 

Any of these defaults can be changed as desired.
